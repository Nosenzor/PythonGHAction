This is a repo to share my attempts to use GitHub Actions to :
* Create a real conda environment with a cache
* run an "Hello, World" pytest
* get a status

The status is shown as a badge :

  [![Hello World Python CI](https://github.com/Nosenzor/PythonGHAction/actions/workflows/helloworld_ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nosenzor/PythonGHAction/actions/workflows/helloworld_ci.yml)

The Github actions heavily rely on [Setup-miniconda action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda)
